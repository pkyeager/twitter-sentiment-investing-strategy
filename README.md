# twitter-sentiment-investing-strategy

In this project, I am using Twitter (or X) as the public sentiment indicator to predict the potential of the performance of the company's stock. The assumption is that public sentiment can have an impact on stock prices and market movements.
I pick the top 10 stocks with the highest engagement ratio. Rebalancing of the portfolio is monthly.
